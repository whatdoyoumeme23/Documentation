# Expanding

Creating more income! This is most important to start with. We have a snowball and now we will make sure that it's going to roll. We will use our profits to tier up on these launchpads and expand to other launchpads. Lets say that Seedify tier 8 gives us an allocation of $2000. If we tier up to tier 9, so we have an allocation of $5000, it will make a huge difference once we start participating in 100X + launches. A few launchpads that we are currently looking at are:

* Seedify
* Enjinstarter
* Poolz Finance
* Decubate
* Dao Maker
* Gamefi
* Chain GPT

The goal is to first have 10 million Enjinstarter tokens and to max out to tier 9 on Seedify. Fomotion will make videos on the W3W Youtube[^1] channel to review these launchpads so the community can vote on the launchpas where we have to invest in next.
