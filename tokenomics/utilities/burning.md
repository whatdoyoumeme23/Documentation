# Burning

1. Based on the community votes, we will also use a part of our profits to buy back the $W3W tokens from the open market. After we bought them, we will burn them forever. This will make the token extremely deflationary and helps us to get the price up. On the Dapp you can see exactly how much tokens are burned. We will forever keep on burning the tokens to make sure that not only the money comes from claiming the token, but also making sure that the token itself is going to be worth more.\

2. If you want to unstake your tokens early, there will be a 20% penalty fee. 40% of this fee goes to the development of the project and 60% goes to more burning.\

3. You can play the raffle on our dapp. 2% of the prices that are won will also go to the pentalty wallet: 40% of this fee goes to the development of the project and 60% goes to more burning.\
